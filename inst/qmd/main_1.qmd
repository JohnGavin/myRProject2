## TODOS
+ qmd yaml to convert this page to dashboard!
+ **adding a .nojekyll file to root of source**
  + branch will bypass the Jekyll build process
  + and deploy the content directly
  + e.g. if GitHub Actions is unavailable/disabled
+ https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#about-publishing-sources
  + "if not dedicated branch to hold compiled static files
  + source folder = 
    + root of the repository (/) on the source branch or 
    + => write GH Actions workflow to publish site."
    + /docs folder on the source branch.

## Website 
+ **quarto publish**
  + Inf loop?
    + 'Deploying gh-pages branch to website ...'
+ **quarto render --output-dir docs**
+ _site - default rendered website 
    + **FAILS: GH Pages from /docs to /_site**
    + preview the website locally

### `./_quarto.yml`
+ insert `inst/qmd/` 
```
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: inst/qmd/main_1.qmd
        text: Home
      - inst/qmd/about.qmd
```

### `styles.css`
+ move to top folder?
